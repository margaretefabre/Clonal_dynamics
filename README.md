# The longitudinal dynamics and natural history of clonal haematopoiesis

## Motivation

This is the repository, in conjunction with [https://github.com/josegcpa/clonal_dynamics] for [The longitudinal dynamics and natural history of clonal haematopoiesis](). 
In this work, we investigate lifelong clonal dynamics using (i) longitudinal sequencing data from 385 individuals between 54 and 103 years old, and (ii) phylogenetic trees generated from WGS of single cell-derived haematopoietic colonies from 3 elderly individuals.

#### Software

* `R` 3.6.1 - other versions may work, but this was the version the code was tested on
* `Rstudio`
